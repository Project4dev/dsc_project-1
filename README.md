# Project Title :- Disease Prediction System using X-rays or MRI and provide information,precautions measures based on that

# Aim           :- 
                  To create such a system where person can check or predict their Disease using X-Rays, MRI 
                  i.e. Brain Tumor,Pneumonia,Breast Cancer,Covid or based on symptoms i.e. Heart Disease Based 
                  predicted disease user will get information like natual remidies , Exercise Diet etc. 

# Features      :- 
                   basically Doctors can check two or limited X-rays for perticular disease while our system 
                   can check hundred's of X-rays in limited amount of time with   accuracy and faster 

# Future Scope  :- 
                   We will add some features like whenever a user will suffering from any disease our system 
                   will recommend user the best nearby doctors for consultataion and we'll increase the number of diseases

# Description   : -
                  Our system consist of 5 diseases for prediction and provide information,natural way to cure and healthy diet etc.
                  based on that predicted disease
                  
# Technology Used : -
                  Deep learning algorithm to train the models,
                  Django to Deploying the DL models
                  Html,css,javascript,bootstrap for User Interface
